Any plugins you may need help with, contact me via discord. CallowayIsWeird#7502

Info:
===

Optimization - Adds 2 buttons that adds the options if the player would like to optimize or not. Majorly improves performance for clients.

===
Bank - Adds a server-sided bank system that automatically applies to the server. Includes wrappers such as 

ply/client:addReserve(amt)

ply/client:takeReserve(amt)

ply/client:setReserve(amt)

Everything should be working within a database, but you are going to have to create you're own derma and customizability for this banking system.
===

License - adds a license function in where you can assign items by uniqueid a license item, so they can't buy an item from a vendor without a license inside their inventory.
