Information:

Optimization
===
Adds 2 buttons that adds the options if the player would like to optimize or not. Majorly improves performance for clients.

Bank
===
Adds a server-sided bank system that automatically applies to the server. Includes wrappers such as 

ply/client:addReserve(amt)

ply/client:hasReserve(amt)

ply/client:takeReserve(amt)

ply/client:setReserve(amt)

Everything should be working within a database, but you are going to have to create you're own derma and customizability for this banking system. No NPC comes with this, it is purely serversided.


License
===
adds a license function in where you can assign items by uniqueid a license item, so they can't buy an item from a vendor without a license inside their inventory.

Medical Bills
===
Takes away money from a players bank (must have bank plugin), and if they don't have enough money inside their bank, it takes it from their wallet upon death. Customizable via F1 Menu, the value & if it's enabled or not.
